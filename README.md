__eirine__ is a flat-file, nodejs-based Content Management System (CMS) that is developed and maintained as open-source project. I have chosen Express.js in TypeScript as development framework to make __eirene__ lightning fast.

## Setup & start

- Install npm dependencies `npm i`
- Start eirene `npm run eirene`

## Features

- Express.js core written in TypeScript
- Content files written in YAML
- Routes automatically recognized from pages-folder structure
- Shared content separated
- Handlebars templates
- Component based approach && page-based approach both possible
- Components include templates and optional controllers
- SASS styling

## TODO:

- Add example project
- Add user/roles & auth-extensions
- Add futher template engines
- Add JS bundler for frontend
- Add admin-panel (maybe own repo)
