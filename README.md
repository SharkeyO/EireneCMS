__eirine__ is a flat-file, nodejs-based Content Management System (CMS) that is developed and maintained as open-source project. We chose KOA in TypeScript as development framework to make __eirene__ lightning fast.

## TODO:

- Add CMS config file
- Add SASS/SCSS compiler
- Add extension controller
- Add example project
- Add user/roles & auth-extensions
- Add alternate data sources (db & api)
- Add futher template engines
